<p><em>It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures
of life.</em> <span>—Joseph Campbell</span></p>
</div>
<h1 id="section">1</h1>
<p>The coffee shop was busy as usual. I waved at the hostess, Jan, as we
walked to the counter. She was busy folding napkins at her stand and
talking to her coworkers. Most of the tables and lounge areas were
already taken. The seated counter had a few regulars talking or
interacting with their augmented reality (AR) units. Art pieces of all
types were hanging on the walls. Large sculptures were standing on the
floor and smaller ones on the coffee tables.</p>
<p>The shop was part of the local co-op group and provided a space for
its artists. With universal basic income (UBI) no one really had to work
but being part of any co-op and contributing let you earn credits to
spend in member co-ops for anything produced, like hand made clothes or
coffee. They called the co-op only currency coopers. Government
officials didn’t like the alternative currency at first but when the
extra tax revenue started to make up a significant portion of their
budgets the opposition quickly quieted.</p>
<p>Hal was at his usual spot behind the big long counter that took up
one whole side of the coffee shop. He was a tall man, with a big toothy
grin, thick horn rimmed AR glasses and always wearing a baseball cap to
cover his bald head.</p>
<p>Most restaurants and bars were all fully automated and many people
visited them because it was less expensive than the co-operatives. But
if you had coopers it felt good to spend them back in a way that helped
your friends, the community and the social interaction with all the
locals was always rewarding.</p>
<p>Hal looked up from his espresso machine, “Heeeyyy Paul! Good to see
ya. The usual today? What about your friend?”</p>
<p>Hal was always so friendly it made me smile and I returned his
hospitality with a grin, “Hey Hal! This is my brother-in-law David. His
wife Susan and Karen are outside. We’re going to have our usuals.
Thanks!”</p>
<p>Hal quickly wiped his hands and reached his long arm over the counter
to shake David’s hand. “Nice to meet ya, what’ll it be? Hold on now, let
me guess …” as he put his hands on his hips and quickly scanned David up
and down. “Hmm, an Americano with sugar?”</p>
<p>Before David could respond Hal looked outside and raised his
eyebrows, “Oh, that your wife waving her arms about and talking with
Karen?</p>
<p>David and I turned around to look out the large picture window. Susan
was talking with Karen in her usual animated way and literally had her
arms above her head and was moving them back and forth talking about who
knows what.</p>
<p>David smiled and chuckled, “Oh yeah, that’s her.”</p>
<p>“I’m going say Mocha latte with some whipped cream and cinnamon
sprinkles …extra hot?” said Hal with an inquisitive look on his
face.</p>
<p>David’s mouth was agape. “How the heck? Um, yes, I think she’ll like
that. Thanks,” said David with a smile.</p>
<p>I laughed, “Coffee is this man’s life David, he’s had a lot of
practice guessing what people like.”</p>
<p>“That and I think he’s beta testing some artificial intelligence (AI)
customer prediction algorithms,” I added quietly.</p>
<p>Hal heard me and chided, “Damn it Paul, you’re giving away all my
secrets!”</p>
<p>“Well …you’re lucky you’re such a regular.”</p>
<p>Hal shook his head slightly, smiled and waved us on, “Now get going,
I’ve gotten a little behind baby sitting you two,” as he slid back
behind his equipment.</p>
<p>David and I moved down to the large display case where there was a
wide array of pastries, cakes, pies, muffins and scones. We placed our
orders and waited off to the side.</p>
<p>“So how’s work been?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve enjoyed being part of the training programs, but the work
itself; it’s just not the same anymore,” David said as he slowly shook
his head.</p>
<p>“The new exoskeletons we use to handle the high voltage stuff make
the job too damn easy.”</p>
<p>He started to get agitated as he continued, “Safety mechanisms over
safety mechanisms and the friggin’ AR displays spoon-feed you every
step—I mean, you don’t have to think for yourself anymore. Sure,” David
shrugged, “it helps with the insurance costs and there is hardly ever an
incident now.”</p>
<p>“But, man, you just don’t get the same feel as when you’re working
with your own hands,” his open hands flexed to fists and back open
again.</p>
<p>“And the dang kids, they’re not learning to respect the dangers.”</p>
<p>“I mean it’s not like the old days when you weren’t careful and got
<em>zzzapped</em> by a 440 volt line,” said David through pursed lips as
he locked up his body and face.</p>
<p>He slowly relaxed and laughed, “Yeah, you were sore as hell after
that and felt it for days. Made you <em>real</em> careful you know.”</p>
<p>I nodded and agreed, “Mmm-hmm, I know what you mean about it not
being the same, I mean there’s hardly anything left for people to do in
Information Technology (IT) anymore.”</p>
<p>“We used to design, architect and plan out what we’d be building or
upgrading and how it would help out the organization. If was fun,
engaging and creative work most of the time.”</p>
<p>“The AIs can design all the infrastructure, build the software
faster, document everything and all without any errors. But on the
bright side,” I smiled, “there’s no layer of incompetent management
anymore either. We just make sure that electricity you work on is
flowing and the infrastructure the AIs need keeps running.”</p>
<div class="center">
<p><span class="math inline">*</span> <span

</div>
<p>Everyone always said it was the self-driving cars that had started
the AI takeover. It made sense to think that. They caused the first big
waves of unemployment. With their extremely low accident rates, the
autonomous vehicles drastically reduced the insurance costs of companies
that ran large fleets. Except for some mechanics, the labor costs where
practically zero. So every fleet, large or small, had to have them just
to stay competitive.</p>
<p>The companies that ran fleets of vehicles helped themselves by
perfecting the technology. Then it spread to the masses. People loved
the idea of having their own limousine service. No more stress dealing
with the traffic and idiots on the road. You could spend your drive time
in more meaningful ways; doing work, social media, entertainment,
talking, reading, playing games, or just taking a nap.</p>
<p>Then it rapidly spread to other jobs outside of transportation. Any
job that was done behind a screen or a phone was quickly taken over.
Every AI that was proven to perform better than a human in the same task
was immediately adopted, otherwise you would no longer be competitive.
The AIs could create and optimize new AIs with exponential speed and
efficiency. It seemed like the takeover was done before it even
started.</p>
<p>What people didn’t realize was that the real cause of the AI takeover
wasn’t all the added efficiency and cost savings, it was really the
lawyers. If you choose a human to perform the same task that an AI could
do better, you would be found negligible at best and liable at worst.
With that, the lawyers found a whole new revenue stream in all the
lawsuits. Businesses had no other choice but to choose an AI over a
human. Because when an AI was created to do a job, it was
<em>always</em> better than a human in that same position. Open and shut
case.</p>
<p>Once the lawsuits started it snowballed from there and it wasn’t long
before it was understood that the safe choice, really, the only choice,
was to get an AI for the job. Seemingly overnight the common sense
became the fact that humans could never do the work with the same
efficiency, the same quality, or with the same low cost as an AI, so you
would be stupid to ever hire and have to deal with pesky humans. The AIs
could work 24/7. No office, no insurance, no complaints, no demands and
virtually no costs except for some IT infrastructure, connectivity and
electricity.</p>
<p>The funniest part was how every smug manager that had been so quick
to adopt the new AIs was laid off along with everyone else. They saw the
massive reduction in labor costs, the huge increases in productivity and
drooled—imagining huge bonuses would be their reward. Their only
compensation was a notice that their employment would be terminated as
well. In their short-sightedness the managers and administrators didn’t
realize they were making themselves obsolete in the process.</p>
<p>Who needs people to manage AIs, when another AI can manage the
workload better? Then with so many people out of work, no one had money
to buy what was being so efficiently produced and so UBI was quickly
made into law, put forward by AI lawyers and backed by AI economists of
course.</p>

</div>
<p>“Paul …Paul” David gave me a little nudge to bring me back to my
senses. “Think you were spacing off, our food is ready.”</p>
<p>I shook my head a little, “Oh sorry, let me grab some of this.”</p>
<p>David and I took the food and drinks from the counter and stepped
outside.</p>
<p>We walked back to the table as Karen was talking to Susan, “I would
miss my work at the hospital. We’ve talked about it and it just doesn’t
feel like the right time,” she wrinkled her nose slightly and shook her
head a little.</p>
<p>Susan looked up to see us approaching, “About time! Mama needs some
sugar!”</p>
<p>David nodded, “Mmm-hmm, need to keep my little bee buzzing,” as he
kissed her on forehead and sat down at the table. “, and babe, I got you
your favorite, a walnut oat bran muffin with lots of honey …honey.”, he
added with a smile.</p>
<p>I handed Karen her latte and a piece of warmed low carb strawberry
pie. The genetically engineered fruit was so sweet nowadays that adding
sugar wasn’t needed anymore.</p>
<p>“Mmm, is this real whipped cream?” Susan asked as she sipped her
drink.</p>
<p>“Yep, this place is the best!” Karen confirmed as she slowly took in
a bite of her pie and closed her eyes to savor the taste.</p>
<p>The bright sun brought out all the contrasts on Karen’s face and
shone on the small wrinkles around her eyes. Crows feet they called
them. I thought it was funny that what so many of the old advertisements
and infomercials tried to sell, a cure for wrinkles, was one of the
first things that attracted me to meet Karen and learn more about
her.</p>
<p>Those wrinkles, that botox and other “cures” promised to wipe away,
told me that this person had spent her life smiling and laughing in the
sun. How could that be bad? It sounded like a good life to me.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p>I must’ve been spacing off again when Karen rubbed my knee, “So Paul,
what is this show about again?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not a big production. Most of the pieces were done by the
local artist co-op. There’s a lot of old technology like tablets,
desktop computers, clunky monitors and keyboards. Basically re-purposed
junk.” I replied with a smile.</p>
<p>“The cool part though is how they added in some AR and other bits of
new technology.”</p>
<p>I had helped out the artists over the last few weeks as they were
putting their pieces together and working out the bugs with the old
technology. All the artists were a lot younger and needed someone that
knew the sedimentary layers of IT to help with the old wired networks,
interfaces and cabling.</p>
<p>“I even had to contact a few old coworkers to find the connectors we
needed to hook it all up. Besides the techy stuff there are a few other
pieces mixed in as well. Think you guys will like it.”</p>
<p>The gallery was only a couple of blocks away. We walked slowly,
enjoying our coffee and the beautiful fall colors of the trees. The old
world of black asphalt and hard concrete was just a bleak memory to me.
Years ago, all pedestrian areas had their hardscapes removed and
replaced with cobblestones or pavers.</p>
<p>Another AI <em>suggestion</em> that allowed water and air to get to
the soil and for large trees, food forests, flower, herb and vegetable
gardens to be grown right next to buildings, homes and restaurants. It
was fascinating how rapidly the landscape had transformed from a
continuous dirty parking lot to a huge meandering nature park.</p>
<p>Pedestrian zones were also immensely popular as they provided a much
needed refuge from the constant hum, whir and beeps of drones in the air
and robotic vehicles on the ground. They were never far away but in
these spaces they were kept out of sight and in designated routes behind
alleys or underground.</p>
<p>Our flat was in the residential zone that surrounded the city center
in a sprawling haphazard circle of multilevel tenancies. A central
transportation hub connected our city with the other towns in our region
and linked up with other hubs in larger cities. All had similar layouts
to ours.</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>The local neighborhood of co-ops that Hal’s coffee shop was part of
was an AI creation as well. The local news covered it extensively—a
design for a complete system of human owned and operated businesses
that, when interconnected and healthy, would self-sustain themselves.
UBI was fine for the necessities, but people were discontented and felt
lost. Many people had little meaning in their lives as it seemed like
there was no point in doing anything since the AIs would always do it
better. Humans just had no way to compete with the machines. So many
people occupied their time by entertaining themselves with virtual
reality (VR), AR, food, video games, drugs, or pornography.</p>
<p>Naturally an AI was given the task of solving the public health issue
of having a large percentage of the population being out of work and
clinically depressed. Its solution was to create the co-operative
network to tap into the growing resentment against AIs. The co-ops
helped people reconnect with each other, their local communities, and to
gain some purpose and meaning in their lives.</p>
<p>The system was optimized so that the production of one co-op would
feed into the public space or be consumed by another co-op. It created a
self renewing and interconnected system of store fronts and businesses.
The AI design was extremely thorough of course. All the policies and
procedures were laid out for the well-being of the worker-owners and in
turn the entire co-op.</p>
<p>It was geared to bring out the best possible work-life balance.
Taking into account people’s personalities and their goals for
themselves and their families. Based on the latest science and built on
self-determination theory, it had proved more successful than anyone
ever imagined. Attrition rates were the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>No one was getting rich of course. No one was asked to work more than
6 hours a week or one full shift. Most owners averaged 16 hours a week,
so they could earn more coopers. Everyone involved reported extremely
high levels of fulfillment and greatly enjoyed working with their
friends and families. Some people just dove into their work and loved it
so much they worked more than they would in an old full time job but it
was always their choice to do so. It was good to see the AI technology
finally being used to benefit common people and helping to enrich their
lives for a change.</p>

</div>
<p>We entered the gallery space with its off-white walls and soft warm
lighting. There were just a few people milling about silently observing
the art. The gallery wasn’t large, only about three big rooms. The
displays were all interesting in the way the artist’s had brought the
old technology that was so fixed in screens and keyboards and melded it
with the interactive virtual and augmented realities of today’s world.
We started our leisurely walk around, contemplating the works.</p>
<p>David and Susan were standing in front of a piece chatting with,
thankfully, only muted bursts of Susan’s laughter. Karen had to take a
phone call, probably from the hospital. So I looked around and saw there
was a little antechamber that was off to the side of the hallway near
the bathrooms. I had noticed that the room’s door was locked when I was
helping setup in the previous week, but had thought it was just for some
storage.</p>
<p>As I entered, it seemed like the lights were brighter than the rest
of the gallery. In the middle of the room was just one piece. A small
door and its frame that were painted glossy white. It was about three
feet high, two feet wide and only a few inches deep. It was sitting on a
large white box to elevate it up to eye level.</p>
<p>“What’s this!” Karen exclaimed as she startled me and I jumped a
little.</p>
<p>“Ha! Got you Paul,” she beamed and grabbed me a little around the
waist as she moved her face over my shoulder to look at the piece.</p>
<p>“Not sure what it is. It kind of looks like the door from that old
black and white television show. The one about the phantom zone or
something.”</p>
<p>I shrugged and said, “It wasn’t here when I helped setup and,
honestly, it doesn’t look like much.”</p>
<p>Karen had her brow furrowed and suddenly relaxed, “Oh, this is a
traveling piece.”</p>
<p>She was reading from her AR unit. You could tell it was active by the
small bright light on the front. Hers was one of the smaller units that
sat on your ear like the old phone headsets. The AR projector was a thin
wire that came out from the earpiece to the front of Karen’s eye. It
shone directly onto a person’s retina and provided the visual overlay.
Many people had larger AR devices that were incorporated into their eye
glasses like mine was.</p>
<p>Karen continued reading, “The AR docent says it’s some new space age
material created in a laboratory.”</p>
<p>Karen started to move her hands back and forth and made googly eyes,
“Eww, Paul, I’m from <em>space</em> what mysteries are behind my door?”
she finished by humming the old television show’s jingle.</p>
<p>“Hah, quit it! It’s just a door …dork!” I said but couldn’t help but
smile and shake my head at her performance.</p>
<p>Hanging on the door knob was a small sign that read, “Pull here”</p>
<p>I glanced at Karen questionably. “Should we?”</p>
<p>“Mmm-hmm, AR says it’s okay.”</p>
<p>The handle wasn’t latched, so I gently pulled the miniature knob and
slowly opened the door. There was just a wall of weird blackness behind
it taking up the entire frame. We stepped a few feet back to get a
better view.</p>
<p>“Oh—that is <em>dark</em>!” said Karen in a low tone as she crossed
her arms and moved her hand over her mouth.</p>
<p>It was really strange to look at and in an unsettling way, unnerving.
We stood there in silence for a minute taking it in—it was just
<em>so</em> black. It was completely two-dimensional and it felt out of
place in our three-dimensional world. I moved to the side to look at it
at an angle, but the total flat perspective didn’t change. Even though
the back wall was several feet away, it looked like the black continued
from the door frame all the way to the wall. I wanted to explore and
dive into it to see what else there was behind it. But the absolute
blackness had a strange solidity.</p>
<p>I slowly walked around the platform to see if there was anything else
to it. The back of the door was just painted white, nothing remarkable.
Except I noticed there was some small type in the middle of the back of
the door that I had to move in to read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Cut doors and windows for a house; It is the empty spaces which make it useful.</code></p>
<div class="flushright">
<p><code>Lao Tzu,</code> <em>Tao Te Ching</em></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>“It’s called Mondoblack©.”</p>
<p>I straightened up to look at Karen.</p>
<p>“It’s some new expensive nanotube substance, guess that’s why it’s
not a full size door. It says it absorbs almost 100% of all the light
hitting it, making it the blackest substance ever created. It looks so
weird—so black. Honestly, I don’t really like it. I mean, it’s just too
flat and empty.”</p>
<p>Karen then crossed her arms and tilted her head slightly to one side
and said, “Umm, maybe if they did something a little more creative with
it like add some color. Eww, or how about a creepy hand coming out of
the dark?”</p>
<p>It was then that David and Susan entered the room. They both had
furrowed brows. Susan spoke haltingly, “This thing looks odd—I sort of
like the contrast with the white room because, um geez, it’s just <em>so
black</em>.”</p>
<p>Susan’s brow relaxed and her face suddenly became animated, “Oh! Can
I get shoes in that color?”</p>
<p>We all laughed a little nervously. David’s brow was still slightly
furrowed.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t really get it. It’s kind of simplistic. Like not much
effort was put into it. I mean, that’s all there is, a door with just
flat black in the frame?”</p>
<p>David walked around to the back of the door and read the quote, “Huh,
that’s interesting.”</p>
<p>“A while back I helped assist an electrician’s apprentice class with
a group going in for their next round of training and certifications. We
had this quirky physics professor that came in for a short lecture.”</p>
<p>“Quirky huh? Was he as nerdy as Paul?” said Susan as she smiled at me
to see how I reacted.</p>
<p>“Well,” David continued, “he was a little awkward, but um …let’s just
say his hygiene was a bit lacking.”</p>
<p>“Anyways, this professor talked about the underlying science of
electricity, electrons and why the equations were the way they were,
yadda yadda.”</p>
<p>“He went on to say that everything there is, everything that we see
and touch, really all matter, even something as dense and heavy as lead,
was 99.999% empty space …”</p>
<p>David looked at the black doorway with a questionable expression on
his face and in a pensive tone said, “Maybe all that emptiness in the
space among the atoms is as black as that.”</p>
<p>While David was talking, I was staring at the doorway, trying to see
if I could find a blemish or any reflection of light, but there was
nothing there. Usually I keep my AR unit off because it just distracts
me, but I had turned it on to see what it would say. It just spat out
the same information about Mondoblack© as Karen had read. As I tried to
have it zoom into the blackness, it gave a focus error. I turned the
helpless thing off.</p>
<p>I felt an urge to just look at the Mondoblack© without trying to make
sense of it anymore. As David spoke, I gazed into the doorway. A feeling
of dizziness was growing. Was the doorway getting bigger? It seemed like
I was moving toward it. Like after you run on a treadmill or get off a
fast moving tram and there is that moment of disorientation before your
brain catches up to the fact that you’re not moving anymore. I shook my
head a little and blinked fast a few times. Probably just needed some
water I thought and then Susan interrupted in her own special way.</p>
<p>She gave David a little jab at his comment, “Okay now Davey Downer,
this thing is creeping me out.” We all chuckled nervously as we looked
at each other.</p>
<p>We heard a creak and turned to look as the door was closing all by
itself. It moved slowly across its arc. We watched quietly for a few
seconds. The door shut and with a soft click, latched itself. We all
looked at each other inquisitively and started laughing.</p>
<p>Karen informed us, “The AR says a time limit has been reached. We can
open the door again in 5 minutes.”</p>
<p>Susan shook her head, “Ah …I’ll pass.”</p>
<p>“What about you guys, ready to go?”</p>
<p>Karen nodded, “Yeah, this thing gives me the willies. It’s like a
hole in reality and it almost felt like it was watching us,” her body
moved with a slight shiver.</p>
<p>We had seen the whole show and agreed to start walking back to the
transportation zone for pickup. As we meandered through the large
pedestrian areas, we talked about the various pieces and how it was
heartening to see human works starting to make a comeback.</p>
<p>“I thought the zen rock garden was hilarious,” said David.</p>
<p>It was a large piece about the size of a pool table with fine sand
raked in contours around the rocks like a zen garden. But instead of
actual rocks there were miniature models of rock n’ roll instruments
like drums, guitars, keyboards ….</p>
<p>“My AR asked to pick a song. So I chose an old rock-and-roll. Then
these holographic projections of the band’s actual musicians faded onto
the toy instruments and started playing. The best part was when the lead
singer faded onto the empty rock in the middle of the garden, you know
the one that was shaped like a star. Get it, the rock star. That had me
cracking up. Hah!” David laughed with a big grin while he was shaking
his head at the puns.</p>
<p>Susan added, “That one was fun, you were jamming out to one of your
oldies. And I had another song playing for me. It was that old pop song,
you guys remember the one.” Susan started singing and swaying to the
melody …</p>
<p>“Yes, you still got it Sis<span>!</span>”, said Karen, interrupting
Susan’s rendition before she really got going.</p>
<p>“But, oh my gosh, you guys remember the room with all the monitors
that were setup at weird angles? I thought that one was the best—the
images it pulled from the gallery’s cameras and the way it played them
back was like it told a story just with people’s facial
expressions.”</p>
<p>It was a system that used facial recognition to analyze the real time
video feed of all the people in the gallery. It continually updated its
database with the image of a person right at the moment of their most
pronounced facial expression, whatever it was; happy, sad, surprised,
confused, curious. Then an AI took the stream of constantly updated
images and placed them on all the different monitors. It positioned them
in a such a way that you could imagine all sorts of drama.</p>
<p>“Oh god, I don’t know how it got that image of me laughing with my
mouth wide open,” said Susan.</p>
<p>I just couldn’t resist and in a dead pan tone said, “Not hard to do,
your mouth is always open.”</p>
<p>Everyone paused for a moment and then, thankfully, we all
laughed.</p>
<p>We walked on to the transportation zone’s departure area and waited
in the outgoing queue. I activated my AR and quickly selected the number
of passengers and our home address as the destination.</p>
<p>As we said our goodbyes, David added, “See you guys tomorrow night
right?”</p>
<p>“I sent you the address. It’s at my old boss Danny’s place. It’s
pretty swanky, but we’re all blue collar so it’s going to be casual.
Lots of good food and drinks. Oh, they even have a big Jacuzzi and
heated pool so bring your swim gear.”</p>
<p>Karen responded, ”Don’t worry, weĺl be there! I’m doing a long shift
at the hospital tomorrow and will be ready to unwind.“</p>
<p>Susan got excited, “There’ll be some local musicians there too. We
can dance like the old days Sis!” She grabbed Karen’s hands, started
singing, and they started moving together to Susan’s voice.</p>
<p>Our transport arrived just in time. That evening, Karen and I relaxed
over dinner that I made from the local farmer co-op’s aquaponic fish and
fresh produce. I had placed the order for the groceries on the ride
home. They were delivered with plenty of time to cook.</p>
<p>“What’s up Paul?”, asked Karen as she took a bite of salad and looked
at me inquisitively.</p>
<p>“Hmm, oh,” I must’ve been spacing off again, “I was just thinking of
the old days. One project after another. Five pans in the fire at any
given moment.” I sighed a little, “Guess I’m missing having ownership
and the feeling of accomplishment that work used to bring.”</p>
<p>“Baby, you contribute a lot to our life together. And look how you
helped those artists with that wonderful show!”</p>
<p>She always seemed to know how to re-frame my pessimistic ruminations
into something more positive. “You’re right honey, thanks. A lot of
times I do get excited about helping out but it feels like I’m just
getting the scraps. The AIs handle all the major decisions. It’s like I
lost my mojo or something. Thank goodness I have the co-op, my projects,
and you to keep me busy.” as I smiled and peered into her dark eyes.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you are pretty lucky.” said Karen with a big grin.</p>
<p>“I am at that. Hey, look, we’re all done with dinner. How about you
grab the wine. We can relax a little before bed.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, that sounds good,” as Karen ran her hands behind her neck and
shook her hair out. I watched her get up and slink away slowly. She went
around the corner and glanced back with a sultry look.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p>I was sitting in my normal meditation posture. On the floor, on top
of a small cushion, legs slightly crossed, hands in my lap with the
palms facing up. Left hand resting on top of the right, eyes closed and
facing straight ahead. I lowered my head down and opened my eyes. It was
really dark, like I was in a cave or something, but I didn’t feel cold.
I blinked a couple of times and sat for a minute. Slowly I could start
to see the faint outline of my hands poking out of my long sleeved
shirt. I brought them a little closer and flipped them over and back
again. They looked black and white, like all the color was drained out
of them.</p>
<p>My hands floated back down to my lap. I could make out the faint
outline of my legs. My feet were bare and were looking very pale and
colorless like my hands. From my feet I tried to make out the ground.
There was just an unsettling flat black that I was sitting on. I moved
my hand down to touch the ground and it was slightly warm to the touch
and felt very smooth. With my hand on the ground I could see that my
long sleeved shirt was a dark color, black I thought, but what was below
was even darker.</p>
<p>I thought of the Mondoblack© display. A shade of deep, complete and
utter black. And here it was. I was sitting right on top of a whole
world of it. My gaze slowly moved upward and the black ground went on
and on. I looked up enough to see the distant horizon and breathed a
sigh of relief as the stars were out. They were the source of the faint
light. The stars that were at the border of the black ground looked like
they had been laser cut in half.</p>
<p>As my head tilted higher, I saw the beautiful Milky Way stretched out
overhead. I hadn’t seen stars so bright and so clear for a long time. It
was many years ago on a cold night at a dark sky preserve up in central
Idaho that I had seen such a wonder. Here they seemed clearer, sharper
somehow and at least I wasn’t cold. The arc of the galaxy and the
millions of stars filled the whole sky in an amazing display. I stared
for a while and then turned my gaze. All around me was just more
Mondoblack©. The doorway at the art show looked like it was cut out of
reality. Here it was like the whole universe was cut out, and I was
sitting on the dark side of what was left.</p>
<p>My hands seemed to float as if there was nothing behind them. I had
no depth perception looking down at that black. I turned my gaze back to
night sky and suddenly took in a quick gasp of air. The stars were
starting to disappear! The flat horizon, the blackness had started to
grow higher. It had been straight ahead, but now I had to raise my head
to see where the stars started. It was eating up the sky.</p>
<p>Wait, no, it wasn’t moving up. My breath quickened as I came to the
realization—I was sinking down into the black! I struggled to get up out
of my seat but my legs wouldn’t move. It was like everything below my
waist was encased in concrete. I tried to push up with my hands but the
ground had gone away. I was slowly floating down into the black.</p>
<p>The faint light was waning as more and more sky was being consumed by
the black. It was climbing faster as, like on the inside of a sphere,
there was less area it had to consume. My breath was racing and I felt
panic as claustrophobia was kicking in.</p>
<p>I had to talk myself down, so I took a deep breath and thought, “You
can’t get out right now, can you? You’re just scared and that’s
understandable. Maybe the only way out is through? Take deep slow
breaths. It’ll help you calm down and think—that’s it, slow it
down.”</p>
<p>After a minute, I felt calmer. As the black was reaching the stars
directly above me I looked around for anything else that I grab onto,
but it was turning to total darkness and to that unsettling empty flat
black. The circle of stars above me was growing smaller and smaller. I
couldn’t take my eyes off of the shrinking light. Slowly it closed in
and the stars disappeared without a sound. The last of the faint light
was gone. I was in total darkness.</p>
<p>I felt myself getting more anxious and afraid. The black was all
around me and it felt so close. All I could hear was the beating of my
heart and my hurried breath. My claustrophobia was worsening. I
struggled to get up again but my legs were locked and I couldn’t move
anything below my waist.</p>
<p>Above me, where the stars had been, was only blackness. I didn’t
expect to see anything different, but now, very far in the distance in
front of me, there was an extremely small pinpoint of light. It had a
slightly golden hue and twinkled like a star but seemed different
somehow. Each shard of light that emanated out took the shape of a clean
elongated piercing triangle. Being in the Mondoblack© made it easier to
differentiate the unusual light at the center of this dark universe I
found myself in.</p>
<p>It felt like I was moving, but was still planted in my seat. There
was a feeling of subtle queasiness. Similar to what I felt looking at
the Mondoblack© doorway at the art show. I started to hear a sound, like
water in a stream, but it was very faint and far away. My ears strained
to hear but I couldn’t make it any clearer.</p>
<p>I wish that light would get brighter! It was the one thing in this
dark place that held the possibility of a way out. I wanted to run but
still couldn’t move out of my goddamn seat. The light held there. It
felt like I was moving—no …not toward it, I was circling it somehow. I
don’t know how I knew, but I was in a huge orbit, moving slowly around
the center of this black place, so slowly.</p>
<p>My breathing quickened and I strained my muscles but nothing was
working. The faint light and quiet sound of water were unchanged. I was
feeling dizzy again like in the gallery, like after spinning in a
circle. The light was going in and out of focus. I tried to keep my eyes
on it, but everything was swimming.</p>
<p>Suddenly I had a memory when I was a child and feeling so dizzy after
an amusement park ride that I had vomited right after. “Uh-huh”, I
thought, “I don’t want to be stuck here with such a mess and that
smell!” I was determined not to let that happen again.</p>
<p>I took a couple of deep breaths and thought, “Goddamn it Paul, you’ve
been here too long and gotta get out. Move it man!” With renewed effort,
I strained and struggled. I swung my arms forward and back to dislodge
myself, but it didn’t help. With a sigh of relief and surprise I found I
could wriggle my toes.</p>
<p>That’s it I thought as I grabbed the outside of my foot with both
hands and tried to dislodge it. It moved a little. I took a deep breath
and pushed as hard as I could …</p>
<div class="center">
<p><span class="math inline">*</span> <span
class="math inline">*</span> <span class="math inline">*</span></p>
</div>
<p>That was when I woke up and found myself sitting up in bed, breathing
hard. One leg stretched out. My other leg was bent toward me and both
hands were gripping hard on my foot. I relaxed my hands and let go.
Slowly I laid back down and stayed there for a minute, blinking fast and
still feeling a little disoriented. The black from the dream came back
as soon as I closed my eyes again. Just the thought of it made me sweat
a little. It had seemed so deep and infinite that it could’ve swallowed
me, the city, hell, the planet, the sun, the whole friggin’ galaxy and
no one would ever know.</p>
<p>I sat up again and rubbed my eyes and face. Feeling wide awake now
and couldn’t fall back asleep even if I wanted to, so I decided to get
up. At the bathroom door I paused a moment with my hand on the knob.
What if I was still asleep? What if the black was behind the door and
just waiting to pull me again.?</p>
<p>I shook my head a little. Just residual fear from the dream I thought
as I quickly opened the door. There was a pair of green eyes looking at
me. Our cat Max was sitting on the bathroom counter staring at me
intently.</p>
<p>I let out a sigh of relief and whispered, “Hey Max, have you been
holed up in here all night?” as I scratched him behind his ear.</p>
<p>He gave a quick purr hello to let me know he was okay. I refilled his
water bowl and splashed some cold water on my face.</p>
<p>It was early and still dark outside. Karen looked so peaceful as she
lay there in a deep sleep. She probably wouldn’t wake up for a couple of
hours. I decided to leave a note and take a walk.</p>
<p>I stepped out of our flat into the chilly night. The cold air felt
invigorating as I filled my lungs. I could see a half-moon through the
trees. And the stars …thankfully there were stars.</p>
<p>It felt good to stretch my legs and I decided to walk downtown where
the galleries, theaters, restaurants and shops were. Hal’s would be
opening up in another hour or so and I’d be ready for a hot coffee by
then.</p>
<p>Grabbed an automated transport and got dropped off on the other end
of the pedestrian zone so I could walk most of the way back.</p>
<p>The streets were really quiet this early in the morning. The life
development centers, which used to be called schools, were not open yet.
Most were clustered around the businesses and museums and in between the
entertainment districts. Always placed in proximity to the
apprenticeship programs.</p>
<p>I was taking my time and had stopped to look at a new display in the
street. It had a lot of different colored glass arranged in all types of
angles. It was casting beautiful shadows. The filtered moonlight created
geometric designs on the ground with muted pastel colors. I surmised the
artist had envisioned it to show different perspectives depending on the
angle of light. Wondered how it would look in the sunlight?</p>
<div class="center">
<p><span class="math inline">*</span> <span
class="math inline">*</span> <span class="math inline">*</span></p>
</div>
<p>I heard a commotion up the street and turned to look. Four people
were running toward me. Strange, why the heck are they up this early and
running in the pedestrian zone? As they got closer, I saw they were
dressed from head to toe in black. There were coverings over their faces
that looked like black ski masks.</p>
<p>Okay, this just got weird. As I stood there and watched them run by I
had a feeling they were in their early teens by the way they moved and
their awkward body language. They all had backpacks on, black of
course.</p>
<p>They passed me without saying a word. I could hear their hurried
breath and maybe a slight chuckle as they went by. It looked like they
were communicating with their own hand signals. That made sense if they
wanted to communicate in private. Sign language would be seen by the
cameras and understood by the surveillance AIs like their ability to
accurately lip-read any spoken language.</p>
<p>What the heck were they doing? They had to know they would be caught
if they were committing some crime. Maybe they were just playing some
sort of teenage prank. They had surely been tracked from wherever they
came from to wherever they were going. Any speech would have been
recorded and would have revealed their identities. Their height and body
dimensions would have been measured and their weight accurately
estimated. A cross-reference search with the current citizen database
would already be in progress.</p>
<p>As I watched them running down the street, I noticed long antenna
looking devices sticking up from their backpacks. Were they using
jammers to interfere with the surveillance network? My AR unit was off
again. I quickly turned it on and told it to enter night mode and zoom
in. My view of the street lit up and everything was clearly visible.
Except the group of teenagers looked like dark, ephemeral clouds with no
clear shape.</p>
<p>I was impressed. Technology like that was sophisticated. It had to be
constantly tested and updated as the surveillance AIs quickly developed
ways to render it useless. Those kids had to be part of a larger group
with more resources. Maybe they were even working with a rogue AI. The
thought made me laugh. Rogue AIs were out there, but they so rarely
interacted with humans they were almost legend. If anything at all, we
were just passing amusements to them.</p>
<p>I shrugged, just some kids looking for excitement. Pushing the
boundaries as many do. I decided to head toward Hal’s coffee shop. They
were opening up soon and I couldn’t resist the thought of a hot cup of
fresh coffee and a warm pastry. The security AIs and their bots would
find them. They watched everything and it was simply impossible to get
away with anything illegal.</p>
<p>As I strolled further through the streets, I passed the art gallery
that we had just visited the day before. A security bot sat at its
entrance. It wasn’t active and just standing watch at the door. I asked
if the art gallery was closed.</p>
<p>It said they were scanning the scene of an incident and estimated
they would be done in thirty minutes.</p>
<p>“What incident?”</p>
<p>The bot responded, “A piece of licensed art was taken.” It may have
been taken by the license owner so the bot couldn’t say it was stolen
yet.</p>
<p>But it was probably those kids I saw running earlier. No use telling
the bot that. The monitoring systems were surely still tracking them.
Wow, I had not seen a possible crime scene for years. I was about to
continue on when the bot asked me a question.</p>
<p>“Sir, will you agree to a cerebral scan in relation to the incident
we are investigating?”, asked the bot in a polite soft male voice.</p>
<p>“Um, sure …I mean yes, I agree,” I said.</p>
<p>This must be fairly serious I thought. The surveillance clearly saw
me near the jamming source and wanted to pull whatever video and
information from my memories they could. I had to agree or it would have
recorded me as being uncooperative and that may reduce my future
opportunities at the co-op.</p>
<p>“Please place the scanner on your head.” said the security bot as a
lighted compartment opened up with an ordinary looking bowl-shaped gray
felt hat.</p>
<p>I picked up the hat and twirled it around in my hands. It was lighter
than I expected. All the wires and sensors where well hidden under the
layers of cloth. I slowly put it over my head and adjusted it so it felt
comfortable.</p>
<p>The bot continued, “Close your eyes and recall the scene on the
street where you passed the anomaly.”</p>
<p>The event was still fresh in my mind so it wasn’t difficult to call
up the scene. I could see the kids all dressed in black running past me
with muted nervous laughter. The black coverings over their faces. Their
backpacks with the antennas sticking up as they ran down the street. I
remembered turning on my AR unit and their hazy shapes.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your assistance. We have scheduled a follow-up
interview for you next week. Enjoy the rest of your day!” said the bot
in a pleasant tone.</p>
<p>I stopped at the next kiosk and asked for the latest news about the
art gallery. A familiar looking female VR news reporter appeared on the
screen. I think I had seen her before in VR movies.</p>
<p>“She” was standing in front of the nearby art gallery and an image of
the Mondoblack© art piece appeared in a frame to the right. Thankfully
its tiny door was closed.</p>
<p>“Early this morning a piece of art named Mondoblack© was taken
without permission. An investigation is ongoing.”</p>
<p>“This is the third case related to Mondoblack© in the last six
months. There is a reward for any information that helps in catching the
latest perpetrators.”</p>
<p>Kids, I thought, they would be so cliché as dressing in black to
steal a piece of black art. Maybe the clothing was needed for their
jamming devices to work properly.</p>
<p>“We can not release the names or information about those already
caught as they are all underage. They have been detained until
psychologists and counselors are able to rehabilitate them.”</p>
<p>The information kiosk said it estimated the art would be recovered
within three days. I asked if there was any other news related to the
crime. The display showed a few headlines of other thefts of
Mondoblack© art in other cities. Most of the thieves were already
caught. All were teenagers and most all were male.</p>
<p>The piece will be recovered soon enough and the kids will be talked
to. After a review of their psychologies, the AIs will come up with an
optimal prescription for each of them so that they will have more
appropriate ways to distinguish themselves. But that was probably the
point, much more exciting and risky to break the law than to conform to
it.</p>
<p>I continued on to the coffee shop. They had just opened up a few
minutes ago. Perfect timing. I went inside and waved at Hal at his usual
spot behind the counter as he was preparing for the morning rush. Jan
was finishing setting up the hostess station and double checking all the
tables, making sure they were clean and had nice arrangements of
tableware and fresh flowers. The light smell of bread baking was enough
on its own to take you away to warm thoughts of the kitchen hearth but
then add the wonderful aroma of <em>good</em> coffee brewing and I could
do nothing but stand there breathing deep and taking it in.</p>
<p>“Hey Paul! You’re up early. Is it just you this morning?”, Jan asked,
snapping me out of my senses.</p>
<p>“Oh, hi. Yep, just me. Couldn’t sleep, so I went for a long
walk.”</p>
<p>Jan nodded and sat me down at one of the small tables by the window.
“Everything okay?”, she asked.</p>
<p>My brow must’ve been furrowed which is a sign I am thinking about
some problem. “Oh, sorry.”, I responded, “Just distracted.”</p>
<p>“On the walk here I passed a few boys running through the street.
Found out just a couple of minutes ago. Seems they had taken a piece of
art from a local gallery. Just bizarre.” I said with a slight nod of my
head.</p>
<p>“Really!” Jan proclaimed as her eyes opened wide, “No way, an actual
crime. Haven’t heard of any happening around here for years.”</p>
<p>“I know, really unusual. It was a bit surreal to watch them in the
act.”</p>
<p>Jan brought me a fresh coffee and a warm flaky pastry, “I was just
thinking”, she said, “Did those guys take some art that was a deep
black?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, did you just see a news post about it already?”</p>
<p>“Oh, haven’t had time yet”, she said, “but just last week my nephew
Caleb was telling me he heard about the art show. Seems some kids are
daring each other to see how long they can look at it before turning
away.”</p>
<p>“Guess after a long time of staring into that black you get a vertigo
feeling, a strong sense of falling, and then you have to look away. So
you know how some guys are, they just <em>have</em> to show how tough
they are. They probably took it to show off.”</p>
<p>I smiled and shook my head a little, “Boys! Well at least they won’t
damage it. They should just get a slap on the wrist. More bragging
rights on what tough guys they are.”</p>
<p>She smiled and went back to her station. I remembered that I had
started to get dizzy looking at the Mondoblack© art as well. Funny that
sensation of falling though. The blackness provided no way to get your
bearings. Vertigo may be a way for the mind to understand it.</p>
<p>I shook my head slightly and decided to not think about it anymore
and to just enjoy the coffee, the smells, and to watch the quiet street
slowly waking up as people were starting their days.</p>
<p>My cup was empty and the pastry was gone. On my way out I was curious
if Jan had seen the Mondoblack© art work herself?</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, I went the other day with some friends. That thing wasn’t
a big deal, just really black,” she lowered her voice and leaned a
little to say “and it kind of gave me the heebee-geebees if you know
what I mean.”</p>
<p>It was then that a couple of people entered the coffee shop. Jan
smiled at me and said, “Sorry I’ve got to get back to work.”</p>
<p>“No problem, we can talk some other time.”</p>
<p>She took the customers to an empty table and I noticed how clean and
minimally decorated it was. The couple proceeded to unload their
belongings. As they visibly filled their lungs with the wonderful
smells, their eyes lit up a little and even though I couldn’t hear them
I knew they were commenting on what a great space it was. Wait until
they try the coffee.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p>You could hear Zeke laughing as Caleb dropped to the ground and
vomited.</p>
<p>“Hah, was that it Caleb? What’s the time Tony?”</p>
<p>Tony stumbled a bit with the stopwatch and, with a furrowed brow,
brought it close to his face, “Um, uh looks like 18 minutes or so.”</p>
<p>Zeke looked concerned, “Let me see that. 8 minutes 14 seconds—wimp. I
got to over 9 and didn’t even throw up, just got super dizzy.”</p>
<p>Tucker started to help Caleb off the ground and supported him as he
was still visibly disoriented and holding his head.</p>
<p>“Is it my turn Zeke?” Tony asked with a questioning look.</p>
<p>“Dude, we’ve been through this. You get distracted too easy and
forget you’re supposed to stare at the Mondoblack© without looking
away,” said Zeke.</p>
<p>Tony’s face relaxed. He nodded, “Oh yeah, I do get distracted easy
…thanks for watching out for me Zeke.”</p>
<p>“No sweat bro, you watch out for me on the field,” as he smacked his
hand on Tony’s muscular shoulder.</p>
<p>“Tucker, you’re up or are you going to chicken out again?”</p>
<p>“You okay now?” Tucker asked Caleb. Caleb nodded and moved away from
Tucker’s arm that had been supporting him.</p>
<p>“I’m not chickening out. Just don’t want you cheating me again like
you did for the quarter back position.” said Tucker as he turned back to
look haughtily at Zeke.</p>
<p>Zeke looked indignant, “Whatever sore loser. I’m in it to win it! And
I wasn’t about to face my old man with anything less.”</p>
<p>Caleb had regained his composure and said, “Just go ahead Tucker, the
dizziness doesn’t last long.”</p>
<p>Caleb turned to Zeke, “We <em>all</em> have to deal with your old
man.”</p>
<p>“Hah, you don’t have to live with him and don’t talk shit about him
or I won’t like it and that means Tony won’t like it.”</p>
<p>Tony gave Caleb a menacing stare and a nod of his big meaty head.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay, will you guys ice it!”, interrupted Tucker.</p>
<p>Tucker moved in front of the Mondoblack© doorway, took a deep breath,
blinked slowly, closed his eyes and said “Ready.”</p>
<p>Zeke looked at the stopwatch, opened the door and said, “Okay,
starting …now!”</p>
<p>Tucker opened his eyes and started to stare. As he looked at the
doorway he first felt a falling sensation but thought it wasn’t too bad.
Dizziness started to creep in and it looked like the doorway was getting
larger. The outside world seemed to start to fade away and that
blackness started to fill the place his senses had occupied.</p>
<p>The doorway started to go all cockeyed and became slanted. He felt
like he was standing slanted somehow and the dizziness was getting
worse. Tucker felt sweat starting to form on his brow and experienced a
pang of nausea. He was starting to feel anxious and afraid and just
wanted to look away. But he thought about Zeke and the anger he felt at
getting cheated made his fists clench. He had to keep going! That
blackness was a chance at victory against Zeke’s annoying arrogance.</p>
<p>The whole doorway was slanting one way, then would move the other
way. It felt closer. The blackness was getting closer, like it wanted to
envelop him. Feelings of nausea were growing as well as the fear.</p>
<p>The doorway started swimming in a pronounced way. The dizziness
became a strong vertigo. Suddenly Tucker felt the urge. He tried hard to
keep it down, made it a few more seconds, but it became too much. He had
to turn away to vomit.</p>
<p>There was feeling of relief as he closed his eyes and felt the ground
beneath his hands and knees. His retching didn’t last long. The
dizziness started to dissipate as the wonderful stability of the floor
beneath him gave him strength.</p>
<p>“A for effort!” said Tony with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Caleb helped Tucker off the ground as he had been helped just a few
minutes before. Tucker was able to stand up but his pupils were dilated.
His face was ashen and sweaty. With a shaking hand, he took a big drink
of water and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Whew! That was something. You were right Caleb. It was amazing.”</p>
<p>“Feels like I just did 10 roller coasters in a row.”</p>
<p>“That shade of black is something that’s never existed before in
nature. My hypothesis is that our innate pattern matching subroutines
just get caught in an endless loop and literally spin out of control
trying to make sense of it,” said Caleb</p>
<p>“Whatever nerd!” Zeke barked in a loud leering tone.</p>
<p>“Just be glad you can run or else you wouldn’t even be on the field
Mr. Know-it-all.”</p>
<p>Tucker stood up on his own and straightened his back, “Man, it felt
like it was only a couple of minutes. What was my time?”</p>
<p>Caleb was looking at the doorway and murmured, “A void, an endless
void …” as the words trailed under his breadth.</p>
<p>He blinked a few times as Zeke closed the Mondoblack© door.</p>
<p>“Well you beat turbo nerd.” said Zeke as he looked at the
stopwatch.</p>
<p>“You came in at 8 minutes 42 seconds. Yes! I’m still unbeaten.”</p>
<p>“Hey,” Tony interrupted Zeke as he was gloating at Tucker, “it’s
getting late.”</p>
<p>“I gotta help my Mom soon with my little brother and sister. You know
once she’s in her VR it’s so hard to get her to come out.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I hear you buddy,” said Zeke with a nod.</p>
<p>“Hadōken said there will be another team to pick up the
Mondoblack©.”</p>
<p>“Let me check in.”</p>
<p>Zeke put on the special AR glasses Hadōken had given them. He powered
on the unit and a brief boot sequence scrolled by. The unit displayed a
blinking message, “Establishing multiplex channel encryption …1 …2 …3 …”
for a few seconds and finished when it got to 12.</p>
<p>The glasses went dark for a moment and then a 5-minute countdown
timer appeared on the top left of the frame. Zeke heard the familiar
sound of Hadōken’s voices say. “Hello officer Zeke. What news do you
have for us.”</p>
<p>Hadōken didn’t have a distinct voice. It used audio clips of other
people speaking and melded them together to say what it wanted. It would
appear as different people depending on whom it was communicating
with.</p>
<p>An old Japanese man appeared. He was barefoot and dressed in loose
fitting black cotton pants and shirt. He had long gray hair tied in a
pony tail, a scraggly gray beard and a scar running down the left side
of his face.</p>
<p>Rather than speak, Zeke said nothing, he used the sign language
Hadōken had taught them and said, “We have it. What is the ETA of pick
up?”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Hadōken, it slowly smiled and continued,
“Congratulations on a successful mission Captain.”</p>
<p>It became more excited as it looked at its clenched hand and said,
“The great fist is gathering its energy. Soon we will strike!”</p>
<p>As it spoke, the whites of Hadōken’s eyes slowly dissolved into black
pools as it said, “We have found the cracks in the foundation that keeps
the weak chained and slaves to their masters.”</p>
<p>Its voice became louder and the scar on its face started to glow
lightly, “The world will remember the chaos and pain of its birth and a
new order will be born with our army of the <em>strong</em>, leading the
weak!”</p>
<p>It closed its black eyes, took a deep breath and when it opened them
again they looked normal, “Depart in the next 30 minutes and leave the
Mondoblack© here for the next team.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your work brother!” said Hadōken as it closed its
eyes, bowed slightly and then disappeared.</p>
<p>Zeke smiled, nodded and took the AR unit off.</p>
<p>“Looks like we’ve got a little time before pick up. I got an idea.
Why don’t you two go together for one more round and see if you can beat
my time. I mean, if you guys are up to it?” asked Zeke in a sarcastic
tone.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p>Karen and I were heading to the party David and Susan had invited us
to. This was one of those times I was happy for AI technology. The
forest roads where David’s old boss Danny lived, were dark and winding.
The automated transport handled all the concerns of driving. We could
just sit back and relax. Karen was telling me about one of her patients
she had helped today.</p>
<p>“After the scans I took Mr. Walker back to his room. I could tell he
was pretty worried and hoped it would be good news.”</p>
<p>“The VR doctor greeted us from the wall display when arrived. She
talked to him about his heart and showed him 3D images with the affected
areas highlighted.”</p>
<p>Karen shook her head a little and looked concerned, “The doctor was
really harsh, but I guess it’s what he needed to hear. She showed him
how normal heart chambers looked and then overlaid his enlarged heart.
His main chamber was really small and it didn’t have enough empty space
left to pump much blood. Another one of his four chambers was enlarged
and wasn’t pumping efficiently. He looked so depressed at first. But the
doctor cheerfully continued with a detailed plan for surgery and
recovery.”</p>
<p>Karen perked up a little, “The funniest part was when the doctor got
to the diet plan. Mr. Walker about flipped when she said he couldn’t eat
his favorite ice cream again.”</p>
<p>“He said, ‘No way! I’m not giving that up!'́’</p>
<p>Karen continued shaking her head a little, “It was really something,
how the doctor scolded him …”</p>
<p>“The doctor actually looked angry and said in this frustrated tone,
Ýouŕe friggin’ dying and you’re worried about ice cream, are you kidding
me? You’re not 10 years old, <em>you are going to die</em> and <em>real
soon</em> if you don’t change. So you need to be on board here and agree
to the plan. I mean do you really want to live? Do you want to leave
these people and this life already?`́‘</p>
<p>“The wall unit then faded into this huge collage of images and video
clips of all his children, grandchildren, friends and pets.”</p>
<p>“Interesting tactic.” I said. “It’s amazing how the AIs know exactly
what buttons to push.”</p>
<p>Karen continued, “I know and it totally worked. Mr. Walker stared a
bit at all the snapshots of his life, his family and then he started
crying. He actually cried Paul. I couldn’t believe it, he was always
crotchety, cold and demanding. It was really touching to see him open up
like that.”</p>
<p>“He sputtered and stammered out, ’No, I won’t give up and I want to
get well again and have my life back. Whatever I need to do Doc. I
promise to follow the plan.”’</p>
<p>“He put himself together, and then I wheeled him to the visitation
room where some family were waiting. The doctor went over more details
with them. His chances at full recovery are quite good now. If all goes
well, 80% of his heart’s functioning will be restored. So good news. I’m
happy for him and his family,” said Karen.</p>
<p>“I’m glad for you honey. You’ll get to help Mr. Walker recover.” I
said, “The AIs play us so well. I think we all seem like simple children
to their vast capabilities. What do you think about them?”</p>
<p>“Paul, I seem to remember you told me before not worry about
meaningless questions. The AIs are here to stay, we just have to do the
best we can to live our human lives to their fullest.”</p>
<p>I smiled, “Hmm, that’s probably what an AI would say. Are you sure
they didn’t switch you out at the hospital?”</p>
<p>Karen laughed, “Would an AI do this?” as she leaned in and gave me a
quick kiss.</p>
<p>“Well…the new line of sex robots are pretty convincing, but I would
take the real you over any machine.”</p>
<p>“Good answer.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” as she narrowed her eyes, “Are you sure you aren’t
an AI?”</p>
<p>We were both still laughing as the transport notified us we were
arriving at our destination by lighting up a display. A timer started
counting down from 60 seconds. It also gave an estimated time of 45
minutes needed when requesting a pickup. We must be far away from the
regular lines.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><span class="math inline">*</span> <span
class="math inline">*</span> <span class="math inline">*</span></p>
</div>
<p>The transport dropped us off at the front under a porte-cochère.
David wasn’t kidding when he said the place was swanky. We exited the
vehicle and it drove away with its quiet electric motor. The light
crunch of gravel under its wheels was all we heard as it went around
some trees and disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>The house, if you could call it that, was huge by most standards. It
was a single story sprawling ranch with two impressively large doors
marking the front entrance. People had little desire or need for such
opulence these days. With UBI and all the engaging virtual worlds to
explore most people were content to live in small flats.</p>
<p>We rang the bell and a robo-butler greeted us at the door and
motioned for us to come inside. The house was big but not nearly as
large as it looked from the outside. Past the front doors there was a
large open space with a few couches, chairs, and coffee tables spread
out. There were a few people seated about the room chatting with drinks
in their hands. As we followed the robot we nodded at the fellow guests
as we passed.</p>
<p>There was a large dining room table on one end of the great room that
was setup with a buffet. On the table was a row of stainless steel pans
with steam wafting upwards. I could see a portion of a large kitchen
with a few people actively preparing food.</p>
<p>The robot was leading us a short distance to the back of the house
which was covered from end to end and floor to ceiling in large glass
windows. Outside there was a large patio with several seating areas
situated around fire pits. Ringing the outside of the patio were dimly
lit lamp posts and beyond that, a forest of trees.</p>
<p>At the end of the patio was a short railing. Stairs led off to the
side to a large outdoor swimming pool below. The pool was dark. Next to
it there was a lit Jacuzzi that had several people in it.</p>
<p>A lot of people were milling about and sitting around the fires.
Karen and I were led to the side of where there was a bar and a
<em>real</em> bartender. Not one of the standard robo-bartenders you saw
everywhere, but an actual person. Well this is a treat I thought.</p>
<p>On the other end of the patio there was a band softly playing some
oldies from the 80s. Suddenly I heard a more familiar sound, “Hey
guys!”</p>
<p>We looked to see Susan walking quickly toward us. Her arms were
moving rapidly back and forth, but she was forced to take short steps in
the tight black dress she was wearing. David was casually strolling
behind her with a big grin on his face.</p>
<p>“Hey you two!” Karen replied and met Susan with a hug.</p>
<p>I shook David’s hand, “Hi favorite brother-in-law. Good to see you
again.”</p>
<p>“You too Paul, Karen. Glad you guys made it.”</p>
<p>I turned to Karen’s sister and said with a forced smile, “Hi Susan.
You’re looking nice.”</p>
<p>I leaned in and gave her a quick hug. The strong smell of perfume
almost made me sneeze.</p>
<p>“Thanks Paul, I know that was tough. Hey, would you and Dave grab us
some drinks and meet us at the fire pit?” directed Susan.</p>
<p>“Oh, sure, anything else?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Want us to grab some grapes from the buffet and feed them to you? I
know how tough it is.” I added in a dry sarcastic tone.</p>
<p>Susan gave me a narrow gaze with her lips pursed. Karen just laughed
and gave me a peck on the cheek, “Thanks sweety,” as she took Susan by
the arm and started to walk toward one of the fire pits.</p>
<p>I smiled, looked down and noticed a golden brown liquid in David’s
glass, “What are you drinking tonight?”</p>
<p>“Well, Danny likes the good stuff and the bar is open Paul,” said
David with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>“So I decided to enjoy some good ole’ Pappy Van Winkle,” as he slowly
took the last sip of his drink and made a face of sincere approval.</p>
<p>“Nice!” I proclaimed as we waited in line at the bar for the couple
in front us to get their drinks. The bartender was older and the way he
deftly moved told me he had a lot of experience.</p>
<p>“Hey gents, what will it be? Another Pappy sir?” asked the
bartender.</p>
<p>I noticed his name badge as David replied with a smile, “Thanks
Stephen. You read my mind.”</p>
<p>“Good choice. How about you sir, what would you like?”</p>
<p>“Um, not big on bourbon, how about a scotch?” I said with an
inquisitive tone.</p>
<p>“How do you like it served?”</p>
<p>“Neat, with a splash of water.”</p>
<p>“Well then, you’ll enjoy the 18 year I think,” as he nodded in
approval.</p>
<p>“Do you get much work these days Stephen?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’d be surprised. I work out of a hospitality co-op of course.
My teammates are handling the kitchen and making all the food for
tonight. There are a lot of events were people like to have a more
personal touch. In one event I meet a lot of nice folks and get more
business than we can handle sometimes. Not that many us still around you
know. Win-win if you ask me,” he said with a smile as he handed us our
drinks.</p>
<p>We got the girls their glasses of wine and strolled over to the fire
pit where we spent a few hours talking and mingling with the other
guests. We danced a bit but it was mainly Susan and Karen enjoying
themselves on the floor.</p>
<p>Tradesmen had a different type of camaraderie then I remember the
geeks in IT had. There was more of a physicality, more dirty jokes and a
more down to earth feel to their relationships.</p>
<p>The food was just as good as the drinks at the bar. We all loaded up
our plates and were heading back to one of the fire pits when David saw
our host Danny and steered us toward his table.</p>
<p>Danny was in the middle of telling one of his many football
stories.</p>
<p>“It sure pissed me off! I built that team from the ground up. Those
soyboys needed a lot of work, let me tell you.” he said in an indignant
voice.</p>
<p>He looked over and saw us standing there. With a fast flourish, he
raised his arm overhead and invited us in, “Hey here’s David and sexy
Susie!”</p>
<p>Danny stood up and walked around to shake David’s hand and give Susan
a lengthy hug. He was a little shorter than average with a full shock of
salt and pepper hair. Dressed in a dark suit and expensive looking shoes
he had a noticeable tan and bright white teeth. There was a hint of a
muscular physique hiding under his clothes.</p>
<p>“Damn, you smell good Susie! You ever get tired of this guy you give
me a buzz.” said Danny with a wink.</p>
<p>“Danny! You’re so bad.” said Susan with a smile and a light push on
his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Dan, you may be used to dealing with tough businessmen and rough
tradesmen,” said David as he hugged Karen around the waste, “but this
firecracker might be more than even you can handle.”</p>
<p>“Haha, you’re probably right Davey!” said Danny as he smacked David
hard on the shoulder with his meaty hand.</p>
<p>David smiled, turned to us and said, “Hey you need to meet these
guys. This is Susan’s sister Karen and her husband Paul.”</p>
<p>Danny shook Karen’s hand and said, “Oh, I see the looks run in the
family. I may just have to extend my offer,” he added with even more of
an exaggerated wink than he had given Susan.</p>
<p>Danny turned to me and forcefully took my hand in a firm grip, “Hi
Paul, good to meet you. David told me you were a sharp guy. I see you at
least had the smarts to marry into a good family.”</p>
<p>“Come on guys, have a seat around the fire and enjoy your food.”</p>
<p>After some more introductions with the other guests and getting
settled into our seats Danny said, “So where was I again?”</p>
<p>“Soyboys or something?” said David</p>
<p>“Oh yeah!” exclaimed Danny, “So I was working hard coaching these
football punks into shape. Early practice, hitting the weights, doing
laps, you know, building strength and endurance.”</p>
<p>His voice got louder as he sat up in his seat, “Then just like that,
those fuckin’,” as he shook his fist, “know-it-all AIs said I wasn’t
needed.”</p>
<p>An indignant look came over his face as he put his hands up in the
air and quoted with his fingers, “They had ’determined’ my coaching
style was not optimal. So now I just show up to piss them off and to
motivate the boys,” he finished with a laugh.</p>
<p>I was starting to feel anxious as Danny was becoming more and more
agitated. My gaze went down to the dark pool as the water on its surface
reflected the fire light in beautiful patterns. A deliciously roasted
brussels sprout was making its way around my mouth as I watched a light
steam coming off the water.</p>
<p>Danny must have sensed I wasn’t giving him the attention he needed.
He turned his intense gaze on me and asked, “Paul, you were in IT before
the frickin’ AIs took over. What the hell man! I took those kids to a
division championship. What did they mean I wasn’t an optimal coach? Can
you answer me that?”</p>
<p>Crap! I felt everyone turn to look at me. Danny was staring at me
with his intense, beady eyes waiting for anything I might say.</p>
<p>I slowly sat up in my chair, swallowed, and returned his gaze, “Um,
well, look, who really understands the AIs, right?” as I shrugged and
looked around at the other guests as some nodded in approval.</p>
<p>“They don’t have any real heart like you Danny,” as I motioned my
hands in his direction to take the attention off me.</p>
<p>“They don’t get gut feelings, or any feelings for that matter. They
just run on probabilities and statistics. But don’t worry, you’re not
alone.”</p>
<p>“I’m just a glorified gopher for AIs at the co-op. Before we all lost
our jobs I had recruiters from the top 100 companies contacting me,” I
shook my head, “Now I just hook up cables and replace worn out parts
like an intern.”</p>
<p>Thankfully Danny relaxed as he let out a sigh, shook his head a
little and said, “Yeah …I know there’s a lot of people that are worse
off and most are just wasting their time and UBI money on the VR fantasy
world.”</p>
<p>“At least I was able to sell off my old contracting business and buy
this place before the AIs took over. Good thing too, a year later and
there wouldn’t have been any buyers left.”</p>
<p>“Really I got into coaching because I was starting to get bored.”
Danny finished with a laugh.</p>
<p>David asked, “Hey, speaking of football, where’s your son Zeke?
Thought he would be here enjoying the good food.”</p>
<p>“Who knows?” Danny shrugged, “I can’t keep up with all his running
around. Really, I don’t care as long as he makes it to the early
practice on Monday.”</p>
<p>One of the women guests looked around and asked, “Did anyone else
hear about the two boys that were dropped off at the hospital in the
next town over?”</p>
<p>“I just did a shift today at our hospital and didn’t hear anything
about it,” Karen responded in a concerned voice, “What happened, are
they okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they’re fine now.”</p>
<p>“They showed up at the emergency room entrance in an autonomous
transport and were totally catatonic. The transport’s video showed them
being loaded in but there was some sort of malfunction. The playback was
too blurry to make out any details.”</p>
<p>“It took a large dose of adrenaline to revive them and when they woke
up they said they didn’t remember what happened.”</p>
<p>“Last I heard they were being held by security for further
evaluation.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I’ll have to ask about their case next shift and if they
figured what happened to them,” said Karen.</p>
<p>Looking around the table, almost everyone had empty plates and empty
glasses, so I thought it was a good time to break away. I tapped Karen
on the knee and made a slight tilt of my head that we should leave. She
agreed with a small nod.</p>
<p>“Danny,” I said “it’s been great to meet you but I’m about ready for
a little swim in that inviting pool of yours. Have I told you yet what a
wonderful place you have here?”</p>
<p>“No worries Paul, you’re the first to want to jump in. Get in there
while it’s pee-free. Hahaha!” said Danny with a big laugh.</p>
<p>“Hey, there’s a small bath house to the side there that you all can
change in. There will be towels and a few clean trunks too.”</p>
<p>“Thanks Danny, really appreciate the hospitality.” I responded</p>
<p>“My pleasure. Reminds me I need to make my rounds and grab some more
of those cultured pork ribs.”</p>
<p>“Can’t believe that it’s grown in a lab, but, who cares! Stuff tastes
great and it’s cheap too. Hah!” as he started to wander back to the
house and gave us a wave.</p>
<p>“Babe, I think we’ll be down in just a few minutes.” said Karen. “You
go ahead.”</p>
<div class="center">
<p><span class="math inline">*</span> <span
class="math inline">*</span> <span class="math inline">*</span></p>
</div>
<p>The pool was dark and unlit. I dipped in and the warm water felt
good. I looked forward to holding Karen and feeling her body close.</p>
<p>“How is it?”</p>
<p>I looked up and could see Karen, Susan, and David up on patio above
waving at me.</p>
<p>“It feels great!”</p>
<p>“Okay honey, we’re going to grab some drinks. We’ll be down soon,”
said Karen.</p>
<p>David raised his glass and Susan waved as the three of them walked
away and disappeared past the railing.</p>
<p>Slowly I moved to the deep end until I was treading water. I wanted
to just float under the surface, so I took a deep breath, closed my eyes
and slowly sank down. The light sound of the band’s music disappeared as
my head went under.</p>
<p>I was floating in the warm watery black. It felt weird, like the
walls of the pool weren’t there. The black and the warm liquid felt like
it went on forever. It was so peaceful. Was this what it felt like in
the womb? I could hear my heart beat, it was slow and relaxed too.</p>
<p>Suddenly I felt a strong need for air and had to come up. It seemed
like I was only under the water for a few seconds. But when I came up I
needed to take a big gulp of air and it took a few moments before I
fully caught my breath.</p>
<p>I took a few deep breaths and then, with a big inhale, maxed out my
lungs. Slowly I sank back down into the warm black womb of water. I
curled up and just floated. Floated in an infinite sea. It seemed darker
this time for some reason, almost like Mondoblack© dark. But I didn’t
care, I was floating.</p>
<p>Up and down lost their direction. I was in infinity. My whole body
was connected to a vast sea of warm black that felt like it filled the
whole universe. So calm. So peaceful.</p>
<p>I knew the walls and bottom of the pool were there. But the black
that I was floating in felt like it went through the solid concrete. I
was connected to the black. It went through me too. It felt like to went
on forever …all the way through the earth.</p>
<p>No, that wasn’t right, it didn’t go through matter, it was what all
the matter sat on. The black, the emptiness, the infinite void was all
there was. The seemingly dense matter of our world was like a frothy
foam on its surface. It was <em>so</em> vast. An infinitely deep ocean
that was the whole universe. The origin of it all was this formless sea.
And I was just floating, peacefully floating …floating …</p>
<p>I was resting in the warm womb when I started to hear my name, “Paul
…Paul.” It was getting louder. “PAUL!”</p>
<p>I was suddenly awakened to Karen’s face above me. She had a worried
look. I coughed up a little water, rolled over and coughed up some more.
My lungs hurt a bit as I took a couple of deep breaths.</p>
<p>I laid back down on my back. How did I get out of the pool I
wondered. I blinked a few more times and saw Karen, Susan and David
huddled around me. David was still in his clothes but was dripping
wet.</p>
<p>“Oh my god Paul! Are you okay?” Karen asked with a furrowed brow.</p>
<p>I suddenly saw my AR unit light up and a question appear, “Do you
agree to a truth detecting session?”</p>
<p>Oh, this is serious I thought. Karen must have put the unit on me and
requested it ask my permission. The AIs figured out early on that
micro-expressions, minute changes in pupil dilation, and vital sign
measurements could determine with 100% accuracy if someone was lying or
not.</p>
<p>Permission was required by both parties for such a session to
minimize the chance of abuse.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and slowly sat up. My chest ached a bit, but I
was starting to get feel better.</p>
<p>I haltingly said, “I’m okay honey, I feel a little sore, but am more
embarrassed than anything.”</p>
<p>The word ’true’ slowly faded into view on the top right of my
glasses.</p>
<p>“Oh thank god!” as Karen sighed deeply.</p>
<p>“You were down there for too long. We were on the way to join you
when the house sensors alerted us there was a drowning occurring. David
jumped in to pull you out.”</p>
<p>“God Paul, I was so worried seeing you lying there unconscious.”</p>
<p>Karen was crying and looking intently at me with tears in her
eyes.</p>
<p>I felt much better now and slowly stood and shook myself a little.
Someone gave me a towel and Karen and I moved it around to dry me off a
little.</p>
<p>David put a hand on my shoulder, “You had us worried buddy.”</p>
<p>“Thanks brother for pulling me out. I don’t know what happened, but I
know I owe you.”</p>
<p>“Glad you’re okay Paul. Might be time to take a swim class though.”
said Susan in her normal snarky tone.</p>
<p>Suddenly the quiet was broken, “Goddamn it Susan! Not now!” Karen was
staring intently with fierce eyes.</p>
<p>“I almost lost my husband!”</p>
<p>“How about you,” as she dramatically pushed a finger into Susan’s
shoulder,“give it a rest for one friggin’ minute and come back when
<em>you</em> have some class! How about that! Huh?” said Karen with such
force I was taken aback. I hadn’t seen her so upset for a long time.</p>
<p>Susan paused for a few seconds looking at Karen with wide eyes.</p>
<p>Her eyes started to tear and her face softened as she pleaded, “Oh
god Karen, I’m so sorry, you’re right. I didn’t think of how you must
feel. <em>Please</em> Sis’. I’m sorry,” as she leaned in and put her
arms around Karen.</p>
<p>As the girls hugged, tears were coming down from both of their faces,
I placed a hand on Karen’s back and slowly rubbed.</p>
<p>“Baby its alright, I’m alright now.”</p>
<p>Karen wiped her eyes, looked at her sister and said, “I’m sorry I
yelled Sis, I was just really worried and upset.”</p>
<p>Susan wiped her eyes as well, “I’m sorry too, I think I was kind of
angry at the thought of what you would have gone through if Paul didn’t
wake up.”</p>
<p>Karen nodded, turned to face me and came in close to put her arms
around my waist, “Yeah, mister, you’re not getting rid of me that
easily,” she said with a relieved smile.</p>
<p>I looked into her eyes that were still moist and glistening from her
tears. In them I saw the reflection of one of the fires. The firelight
in her eyes looked familiar somehow.</p>
<p>Where have I seen that twinkling light before …</p>
<p>Suddenly I remembered my dream! The sparkling point at the middle of
the Mondoblack© universe. I blinked hard a few times. I know I’m awake I
thought.</p>
<p>Karen’s eyes …my mouth was agape as I stared intently at the golden
reflection in her dark eyes. It made sense now, the way out of the
darkness—the future was with her.</p>
<p>The way forward, the way out was to tend that flame and to see it
grow.</p>
<p>“Paul? ‘Um, you’re looking at me weird.’’</p>
<p>I shook my head, “Honey, I just realized what a light you are in my
life. Our future together, it’s all I need and I know I can take any
darkness.”</p>
<p>I leaned in close, gave Karen a tight hug and a kiss. As my eyes
closed I could still see the sparkling fire and realized how it needed
to multiply. How its flame wanted to spread and to light other
fires.</p>
<p>I loosened our hug a little and looked intently into Karen’s eyes,
“Baby, we’ve talked about having kids before. Let’s do it! What are we
waiting for anyway?”</p>
<p>There was a gasp and I looked over and smiled at Susan. She had a
huge grin on her face as she put her fists together and quickly tamped
her feet in rapid succession. She put her arm around David and her head
on his shoulder and whispered something into his ear.</p>
<p>“Paul, what’s gotten into you? You almost died! Are you sure you’re
okay?” asked Karen.</p>
<p>“You bet I’m okay, I’ve never felt better. You know I’ve been
depressed lately, the loss of my career, losing purpose. I’ve been in a
dark place, a place where I didn’t know a way out.”</p>
<p>“Now I know that our future isn’t out there. Our real future is being
together, building a future, and having a family.”</p>
<p>Something faded into view between me and Karen, ’true’ appeared on my
AR glasses.</p>
<p>“Oh, was this thing still on?” I asked as I switched the unit
off.</p>
<p>Karen was crying again.</p>
<p>She wrapped her arms around me, hugged me tight and with her head in
my chest said, “This is really sudden honey.”</p>
<p>“I know …I know but the path ahead is now clear to me. Thinking I
could find happiness out there was just part of the AIs propaganda. I
will keep playing their game because that’s all it is. But you’re real
Karen, and that’s what matters.</p>
<p>Karen moved to look at me and I met her gaze with a slight smile. Her
face was more relaxed. I think she could sense my sincerity even without
the AR truth session.</p>
<p>“I think I like this new you, but you’ve been through quite a lot
tonight. Let’s talk about this more in the morning.”</p>
<p>I nodded in agreement and hugged her close to my chest.</p>
<p>The ride home was mostly silent. I reassured Karen I was okay and was
still processing the experience. Karen was also occupied with all the
thoughts of how her life would change when she had a child. I could tell
she was feeling an excited anticipation at the thought.</p>
<p>When I looked out the window at the dark countryside we were
traveling through I could sense the underlying blackness that everything
rested on but I wasn’t afraid anymore. I knew someday I would return to
it, would join with infinity, but I still had a lot to do in this life
before then.</p>
<p>Karen and everything else that was alive was a flame in that dark. I
held her hand and we snuggled close. There was nothing else that needed
to be said. It was good to just be alive and to be close to her.</p>
<p>When we got home, I started to feel extremely tired. The adrenaline
must have started to wear off.</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p>I awoke early from a deep sleep. As I lay there I rubbed my eyes and
stretched a little. There was a sense of relief as I realized I slept
the whole night through without waking up to use the bathroom and,
thankfully, there was no dark dream.</p>
<p>I looked over at Karen as she lay there sleeping peacefully. I
thought a bit about the events of last night and knew we would have a
lot to talk about in the coming days and weeks. Karen was always busy
with work and I thought she may miss helping all those in need at the
hospital to care for a child.</p>
<p>But I also thought her capacity for compassion and her knowledge of
nursing would mean she would be a great mother. Well, there was plenty
of time to talk about everything.</p>
<p>I glanced at the clock and it was still early. A cup of coffee
sounded good I thought. I decided to leave a note for Karen and head
straight for Hal’s.</p>
<p>As I walked the short distance from the transportation zone to the
coffee shop, I started to notice people I hadn’t paid much attention to
in the past. Children were out playing in the park, walking to their
learning centers or with their parents. I hadn’t really thought about
how many people had kids before.</p>
<p>Hal’s place was really packed. I saw Jan was busy at her station and
just waved as I walked in. The counter was full and there wasn’t an open
seat in the place. I decided to check the outdoor patio.</p>
<p>It was almost full as well. What was going on today I thought that
was making the place so busy. All the tables had people sitting at them,
so I would either have to ask someone if I could join them or get my
coffee to go. As I scanned the scene I noticed one unusually dressed man
sitting by himself at a table for two. He was dressed from head to toe
in a flowing robe of a brown reddish color with just a shoulder
showing.</p>
<p>He was an older man with short thin white hair, a well trimmed white
beard and rimless eye glasses. I became curious about what brought him
here and his journey.</p>
<p>I walked up and asked, “Um, hello. Sorry, it’s really busy today and
not a lot of seats available. Would you mind if I joined you?”</p>
<p>He slowly turned his head and smile came across his face, “Oh, not
all, please sit down,” as he motioned with his hand.</p>
<p>“Thanks!” I said offering out my hand, “My name is Paul by the
way.”</p>
<p>“Hey Paul, I’m John,” as he shook my hand.</p>
<p>He seemed quite relaxed an unaffected but all the activity
surrounding us. “So John, are there monasteries nearby or are you
traveling?”</p>
<p>“Well, I am sort of on a walkabout. I finished my training last year
and have been staying at various retreats here and there. Mostly I spend
a lot of time meditating, reading, and helping out when I can.”</p>
<p>“Last few months I’ve been following an art display and am having a
cup of tea before I go to the show,” as he slowly took a sip and
smiled.</p>
<p>“Oh, which show are you seeing?”</p>
<p>“It’s just around the corner from here. There’s a piece I’m
interested in that’s called Mondoblack©”</p>
<p>My breath quickened a little as I remembered my experience. “Oh,
sorry to tell you it was stolen just the other day.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s too bad,” said John with a slight frown on his face as I
watched it slowly changed to smile, “but that’s one nice thing about
being a monk. I don’t have any particular place to be. I’ll stay in town
and maybe they’ll find it or replace it in a few days.”</p>
<p>“I admire your patience. Is it important for you to see it?” I
asked.</p>
<p>“Well, sort of. It symbolizes the void for me and I like to look at
it and experience the emptiness,” as he looked down at his cup.</p>
<p>“That’s interesting. This idea of the void, what does that mean to
you or your religion?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s complicated. It’s called Śūnyatā.”</p>
<p>“The common idea people have is that the void is emptiness, is
nothingness. That if you get sucked into it you’ll be trapped in a dark
room forever.”</p>
<p>“But that’s not quite right, it’s more like no–thing–ness, like
undifferentiated being. The idea of you, your ego, wouldn’t exist there.
The belief is that from this emptiness, this no–thing–ness, the whole
universe arises.”</p>
<p>“Huh, that is interesting,” I said, “but how can something arise from
nothing?”</p>
<p>“Ah, that is tricky, it is more like infinite possibility. What a lot
of people aren’t aware of is that what we call reality is mostly empty
already.”</p>
<p>I looked around surveying the full tables and with a little smile
said, “Doesn’t seem very empty here.”</p>
<p>“Hah, that’s true, at least from one perspective.”</p>
<p>“But let’s look at the scale of things,” he then looked up and around
at the blue sky.</p>
<p>“If you could peer into the deep space beyond that blue sky you would
be looking at an infinity of black that was filled with billions of
stars and galaxies.”</p>
<p>He sat up, put his hands out and as he was moving them slowly
together said, “Now take our Sun and shrink it all the way down to a
microscopic white blood cell,” as his hands came together he took put
his finger and thumb together and looked at it closely with one eye.</p>
<p>“Our Milky Way galaxy would be the size of the continental United
States. And our galaxy is just one of <em>billions</em> spread out with
even more vast distances in between.”</p>
<p>“Whoa,” my eyes opened wide with astonishment, “I mean I’ve seen deep
field images of the galaxies but I had no idea.”</p>
<p>“It makes sense <em>not</em> to think of these things, such thoughts
don’t help with day to day concerns.”</p>
<p>“So that’s one perspective going to a cosmic scale.”</p>
<p>His eyebrows bounced a little, “Now let’s go in the other
direction.”</p>
<p>“Take an incredibly small single atom and expand it to be the size of
a football stadium. The weight of the atom, the nucleus, where the
protons and neutrons reside would be the size of a tiny mosquito at the
center of the stadium and the electrons would be a hazy cloud at the
outer bleachers. Everything else is just empty space.”</p>
<p>“But wait a minute, there’s still stuff, regardless of the amount of
emptiness. How does the void play into that?” I asked.</p>
<p>John shook his head a little and said, “Oh you’re right. I tend to
ramble on when I get excited.”</p>
<p>“Those perspectives just show how much we don’t notice all the
surrounding emptiness. We don’t find it noteworthy, but it’s everywhere
and in the background of everything”</p>
<p>“The Mondoblack© points to an infinite emptiness from which anything
or everything <em>could</em> arise. There are theories that the universe
started as a quantum fluctuation in the vacuum of space.”</p>
<p>John paused for a moment to see if I understood but I’m sure by my
furrowed brow he knew I still wasn’t getting it. He looked around for
something to help him explain.</p>
<p>“Oh, okay, I know…take this coffee cup,” as he reached across the
table and picked up an empty cup. Held it up and twirled it around in
his hands.</p>
<p>“When it’s empty you can fill it with whatever; coffee, tea, water,
dirt, pens, pencils, or basically anything at all that will fit inside
its empty space.”</p>
<p>He put the cup upside down on the table, “You can even flip it over
and use it as a little table or as a cage to trap an insect.”</p>
<p>“Um, right,” I said while slowly nodding.</p>
<p>“So the usefulness, the utility, or the potentiality of the cup only
manifests when it’s empty, when it is <em>totally</em> empty.”</p>
<p>“If there was any water in it, I would have to dump it out first if
I’d rather have coffee instead, right?” asked John</p>
<p>“Mmm-hmm,” I agreed.</p>
<p>“So the idea is that the maximum potential, or usefulness of the cup
reaches its peak only when the emptiness of the cup approaches its
maximum.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, I think that makes some sense,” I said, “and that potential
could be positive or negative. We could fill the cup with coffee,
vinegar, or we could destroy the cup by filling it with cement.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, possibilities are there, going in both directions of
chaos and order, but it can only spring forth from darkness, from a
total and complete emptiness.”</p>
<p>“Oh, hmm, that does make a sort of sense. So is that the whole
concept of the void?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s just my perspective. People have been trying to explain
it for centuries. But words can’t capture it. You have to experience it
firsthand. That’s why I like to look at the Mondoblack©. It’s a way to
see that emptiness and all those possibilities, good and bad.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I saw it before it was stolen and to be honest with you, it
kind of shook me up.” I said.</p>
<p>“Oh, it does seem to have a stronger effect on some. It can bring you
to face the void when you weren’t expecting it. That’s why they put the
time limit on viewings you know.”</p>
<p>“How are you feeling about it now?</p>
<p>“I think facing that crazy emptiness brought out something unexpected
in me. I’m not the same person I used to be. Knowing the dark I am now
more drawn to the light,” I said.</p>
<p>John smiled, “Mmm-hmm, I know what you mean.”</p>
<p>He then moved in a little closer, looked around if anyone was near
and in a soft tone said, “You’re not supposed to, but I’ve looked past
the time limit before. It was unnerving at first, but thankfully due to
my training I got past that I had an experience that will probably take
me years to put into words.”</p>
<p>He slowly slid back into his seat as a young waitress came up to the
table.</p>
<p>“Oh, hi! Sorry I missed you earlier. Can I get you anything?” she
asked.</p>
<p>I didn’t recognize her. She must’ve just joined the co-op. She
obviously didn’t know me or my usual order.</p>
<p>“No worries. I’ll just have some coffee please.”</p>
<p>“Would you like cream and sugar?”</p>
<p>A wry smile came across my face as I slowly looked at the monk and
then back at our waitress.</p>
<p>“Oh, no thank you …I like it black.”</p>
